                    <p>
                        Children nowadays lack in exploration and outer playing modalities,
                        threatening children's cognitive and creative development.

                    <h2>Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        SeeKuri is a product-service that allows the child to explore the surrounding environment in
                        total freedom, safety, guaranteed by the monitoring of the child by the parent, which is based
                        on a strong concept of parent-child interaction, which goes to forge a bond and create memories
                        that last over time.

                    <p>
                        The solution has been pitched different times to young and new parents, seeking for validation and approval.
                        Most of the sessions ended up with parents very interested and thrilled with our idea, 
                        stating how they would even buy the product.

                <p> 
                    For the goal of the project, different testing sessions were needed, for the app User Interface, Wearable UI 
                    and the communication between device and parent's app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I tested both the app usability from an adult point of view and the device usability from the kid's side, 
                    but more effort and interest has been put in the usage scenarios between the app and the device, understanding 
                    which are the most important ones, coming through the importance of having the products directly communicating, 
                    making it possible to directly call the kid for the parent, but also to send a quick notification to check if the
                    kid is ok.
                </p>

                <h3>Playful learning</h3>

                <h4>Child and parent interact to choose and complete a game!</h4>

                <p>
                    The whole gaming process will happen with continuous interaction between parent and kid,
                    enhancing the bonding between the two and the chances for the kid to learn as much as possible.
                </p>

                <img src="Game1.png" width="100%" alt="">

                <p>
                    The Design of the showed interface and the product that will follow has been chosen in order to 
                    provide a playful, entertaining and stimulating environment, to make children feel engaged and 
                    interested in the product and the activities. <br><br>

                    This is why such a broad and colorful palette has been chosen to have a catchy and attentive interface 
                    not only to attract kids, but also to make parents feel sure and safe about what is happening when 
                    their child is far.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The of this system is to enhance the bonding and relationship between parent and their kid,
                    as a matter of fact, most of the interactions and decisions that need to be taken within the app 
                    have to be taken together. 

                    The interactions are meant to last also after the game is over, going through the albums with 
                    the parent explaining the content to the child and also to be a tool all the moments and the explorations done together.

                    <p>
                        For this project, this design tool was particularly relevant because it helped us 
                        to understand who our customers and main users would be, so which are their needs 
                        and expectations that current products still can't solve.

                        Through contextual observation sessions and related contextual Interviews, the typical 
                        Customer Journey has been defined highlighting the main pain points and  needs 
                        throughout the current experience.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <p>
                    The project need an in-depth development from the gaming point of view, 
                    proving a broad range of options to offer to keep children engaged and 
                    interested in paying with it over the time. Also, the development of the 
                    app and its content over the time will be required, to always satisfy 
                    kids interests and new games.
                </p>

                <h3>What could be improved</h3>

                <h4>Design</h4>

                <p>
                    A mobile app with such interface is really hard to develop, I would 
                    redesign it in a more feasible and achievable way, considering the 
                    different technical constraints.
