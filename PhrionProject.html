                    <h2>Problem</h2>

                    <p>
                        It is a problem that occurs in the use of the virtual reality viewer, causing a severe malaise
                        due to very fast image display as opposed to static and sedentary nature of the user. <br>
                        It can easily be compared to car disease or cruise disease.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="Snapshot">

                    <h2>Solution</h2>

                    <p>
                        Implement the user's body free and natural movements, in fact, being brain processing and movement 
                        perfectly coordinated, the user wonâ€™t feel motion sick at all.

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>

                    <p>
                        We tested the prototype of our project to industry experts, either in the design or marketing industry.
                        Not only to validate our concept, but also to test its market feasibility and usefulness.

                        Also, we pitched our idea and showed the prototype to investors, who were extremely interested and 
                        involved into our project.

                        The thesis has then been marked at the highest grade.

                <p>
                    Phrion would allow users to have delightful retail experiences within the comfort 
                    of their own homes. The only thing they'll need to do is to scan their surroundings.
                    The software will then overlap a digital layer to the recorded physical one, 
                    making them correspond perfectly, to let users walk and interact with elements as they were there 
                    and in a physical form. 
                </p>

                <h3>Move around as in real life</h3>

                <p>
                    The Phrion system is studied in order to let users perform normal movements and gestures,
                    moving around freely and interacting with digital elements.

                <h3>VR Prototype</h3>

                <h4>C# and Unity Prototype.</h4>

                <p>
                    The successful production of the prototype was a crucial and delicate moment of our projects, 
                    very challenging and alienating as well. 
                    It was fundamental to test the idea with users and professionals, to validate the idea and 
                    bring it to even more people. 
                </p>

                <h4>3D Scanning</h4>

                <img src="ScanPhrion.png" width="100%" alt="">

                <p>
                    The University provided us with a room where we could manipulate and move objects around 
                    as we preferred, to then scan it and build our experience starting from that specific space. 
                    <br><br>
                    we used a LIDAR 3D scanner to precisely scan the space and easily export it into the .obj format. 
                    the 3D file has been then imported into Unity, to build the actual experience. 
                    adding then interaction features to the experience coding in C# and applying code to specific objects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Resulting in a digital environment that will respect users' physical constraints, where digital 
                    elements are positioned only where physical ones are already there.
                </p>

                <h4>Interactable elements</h4>

                <img src="PrototypePhrion.png" width="100%" alt="">

                <p>
                    In the digital environment, several interactable elements have been added, with which 
                    users can easily interact or learn and read information that they need for the occasion. 
                    This would be a brand-new way of how users interact with technology, businesses and products.

                    The store in these frames is designed following Vertiigine's brand guidelines and style, 
                    respecting its values and aesthetics.

                    <p>
                        With the information obtained so far, we then developed a persona that could illustrate 
                        the problems and needs about such system.

                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                    <p>
                      The technologies now available in the market would allow to develop it only as a software product,
                      creating a new way in which users can explore ecommerce and brand experiences online. Although, when 
                      the product was developed, even if it was only one year ago, there were no technologies that could 
                      make it possible as standalone. 
                    <br>
                      The innovation process that led me to this solution and all the challenges that were needed to overcome 
                      to realize this project made me realize the commitment that I have to technology and design, understanding how 
                      real products and good ideas come from people and users.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What could be improved</h3>

                    <h4>Design</h4>

                    <p>
                        From the design point of view, I would like to focus more on the actual interaction with such system, how would 
                        it cognitively be, how would humans behave and what are their instincts. The project and the program required it 
                        to be an iterative process, creating a solution and then test it as a continuous cycle, but, if I had more time 
                        I would have liked to explore the solution space further.
