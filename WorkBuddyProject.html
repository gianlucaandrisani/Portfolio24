                <p>
                    Understood the most important information, then I went on trying to figure out how to make
                    buddy a real work companion, one to interact with and to feel appreciated from, so I explored the
                    interaction with the user wireframing the app and testing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I tested the solution of making users more productive through Workbuddy, using a prototype of a timer 
                    passing by while their carrying on their work with a first iteration of Buddy coming up cheering and 
                    supporting the user while finishing the task. <br><br>
                    When asking for users' feedback they were all very satisfied and pleased by the experience, appreciating
                    how they felt Buddy's company and not feeling alone while working made them more focused and determined to 
                    complete the task.

                <p>
                    Once the user starts working, will have access and enter to the Focus Workroom, with Buddy, your
                    personal work assistant, in addition to being a companion, it will strive to create a pleasant,
                    relaxing and creative environment.

                    These themes for the following feature have been chosen to create a relaxed and comfortable
                    environment in which users can feel at their own ease, this is why the blue color. <br>

                    Then the yellow has been chosen because very effective when used with blue on the color wheel and
                    its rules, but specifically is
                    the one which better fits the purpose of task completion and different CTAs because it is more
                    attentive, focusing and energetic. <br><br>

                    The final desired outcome of a comfortable environment which
                    still lead to productivity and attention.

                <p>
                    The product will provide users with the chance to have their schedule fully planned by Buddy,

                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                    <p>
                        Productivity can be a very subjective matter and what works for one person might not 
                        work effectively for another one, this means that some flows and interaction models 
                        can not be proficient for some specific users or some others prefer to manage their 
                        productivity on their own with their own techniques.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What could be improved</h3>

                    <h4>Design</h4>

                    <p>
                        Customization can be a great enhancement for the product, providing users with the 
                        tools for building their own techniques that might even refer to completely different 
                        models.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Engineering</h4>

                    <p>
                        React as a Front-end development technology can be sometimes constraining, with the one-pager app 
                        limitation I then decided to go around the problem implementing different modals 
                        that would perform the different actions, which can make the app heavier and slower. 

                        If I had to develop the product all over again I'd choose a different Front-end technology or 
                        to code in vanilla JavaScript.
