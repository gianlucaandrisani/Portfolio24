                <h4 class="h4-2">Background</h2>

                <p class="p">
                    Athena is a platform designed to match design components from Figma with code components. 
                    The main challenge lies in the system's automatic matching confidence levels, which can 
                    often be low. This low confidence doesn't necessarily reflect the accuracy of the matches 
                    but can lead to user confusion and misinterpretation of the system's capabilities.
                </p>

              <div class="Snapshot">

                <h4 class="h4-2">Problem</h4>

                <p class="p">
                    To allow users to make informed decisions, we needed to grant them more control over the matching table and individual items. 
                    The static confidence score element was confusing for users because it didn't update when they reviewed and corrected matches. 
                    This led to discrepancies and misunderstandings about the system's performance and the correctness of the matches.

                  <h4 class="h4-2">Solution</h2>

                <p class="p">
                    We redesigned the matching table and user interaction flow to enhance clarity and usability. 
                    The new design separates low-confidence matches and provides clear messaging to guide users through the process. 
                    These changes aim to improve the user experience and ensure that the users are guided correctly through the matching process.

                Previously, users could only match components, which limited their control over the quality of the generated code. 
                This lack of interaction meant that potential errors or mismatches could go unnoticed, 
                affecting the overall reliability and accuracy of the code generation.

              <p>
                To address this, I introduced the ability for users to select and then mark components as reviewed 
                or delete them from the table. This enhancement allowed users to verify and confirm 
                each match, ensuring that only accurate and correctly matched components were 
                integrated into their projects

                Users needed more control over the table and individual items to make informed decisions. 
                The static confidence score element was confusing as it didn't change after user corrections, 
                creating discrepancies and misunderstanding. 

                Also, the static score, was not effective because users 
                couldn't see the impact of their reviews and corrections.

            <img src="control-previous.png" alt="">
            <p>
                We introduced a new tab for low-confidence matches, helping users focus on the most critical items first and 
                removed the static confidence score dot to reduce confusion 
                and ensure users understand the impact of their actions on the matching process.

                During the onboarding, no tabs would be show and the process of matching components was even crucial and complex. 
                It was necessary to ensure users were guided correctly to benefit fully from this step.

                In this new version of the platform, we aimed to make the system more 
                flexible to accommodate changes in various design systems over time. 
                We enabled users to add new matches available in both code and design, 
                or delete components that didn't yet have a corresponding match on the 
                other side. This approach ensures that the system remains adaptable and 
                aligned with evolving design and development needs.

                During the design explorations, I initially explored a progress 
                bar to track the review of component matches. However, it proved 
                confusing, as it didn't accurately reflect the dynamic nature of the 
                review process. Users would have misunderstood the system's state and required 
                actions. We removed the progress bar and introduced features for 
                marking components as reviewed or deleting them from the table, 
                providing a more intuitive way for users to manage their workflow.

                    input and feedback in the process was challenging. Users needed to 
                    understand that their interactions were crucial for improving the system's 
                    accuracy and reliability, but conveying this value in a clear and motivating
