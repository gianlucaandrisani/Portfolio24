                  interaction within the app need improvement to enhance the

                <p class="p">
                  Users face several navigation and interaction issues within Appetite. 
                  The chat function is not prominently displayed and is often mistaken 
                  for a support chat. Viewing friend requests and recent notifications 
                  is difficult due to the lack of a centralized notification section. 
                  Lists provide redundant information, making it challenging for users 
                  to see all restaurant lists efficiently. Bookings are not effectively 
                  tracked, and the liked section lacks proper organization. Additionally, 
                  the actions users can perform, such as following or befriending others, 
                  are not clearly differentiated.

              <div class="Snapshot">
                  <h4 class="h4-2">Solution</h2>

                <p class="p">
                  We improved Appetite by making the chat function more prominent and group-specific, 
                  introducing a centralized notification section, consolidating restaurant lists, 
                  and isolating bookings for better tracking. The liked section was organized for 
                  easier access, and we clarified the actions for following or befriending others.

              The profile section was optimized for quick access to favorite places 
              and upcoming bookings, ensuring users could easily manage their preferences. <br></br>
              Previously, lists were separated based on whether they were created by the 
              user or others, but this was unnecessary. Users preferred having all lists 
              displayed together, regardless of the creator. Additionally, a dedicated 
              booking section was introduced, as it is crucial for users to keep track 
              of their reservations without losing any.

              In the groups section, we improved the chat function's visibility and 
              relevance, making it clear that it is specific to each group. Additionally, 
              we introduced functionalities such as creating group polls for dining 
              options and checking members' availability for reservations.

              Control in the Appetite product was significantly enhanced by the 
              introduction of a centralized notification center. This feature 
              allowed users to easily manage and review all their activities in 
              one place, including friend requests, group updates, and dining 
              reservations. By consolidating notifications, users could stay 
              informed and make decisions quickly, ensuring they never missed 
              important updates and maintained full control over their interactions 
              and plans within the app.

              Designing for developers is a challenging task that involves considerable trial and error.

              to ensure the best possible experience that seamlessly integrates into the developers' workflow.

            The main challenge was designing for a broader audience, incorporating feedback from beta users. 
            Addressing diverse user needs and preferences required careful consideration and balancing various 
            requirements. We had to ensure the design was intuitive and accessible for all users, while still
