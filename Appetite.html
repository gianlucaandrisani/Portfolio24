                  friends, and save favorite places. However, user navigation and 
                  interaction within the app need improvement to enhance the

                <p class="p">
                  Users face several navigation and interaction issues within Appetite. 
                  The chat function is not prominently displayed and is often mistaken 
                  for a support chat. Viewing friend requests and recent notifications 
                  is difficult due to the lack of a centralized notification section. 
                  Lists provide redundant information, making it challenging for users 
                  to see all restaurant lists efficiently. Bookings are not effectively 
                  tracked, and the liked section lacks proper organization. Additionally, 
                  the actions users can perform, such as following or befriending others, 
                  are not clearly differentiated.

              <div class="Snapshot">
                  <h4 class="h4-2">Solution</h2>

                <p class="p">
                  We improved Appetite by making the chat function more prominent and group-specific, 
                  introducing a centralized notification section, consolidating restaurant lists, 
                  and isolating bookings for better tracking. The liked section was organized for 
                  easier access, and we clarified the actions for following or befriending others.

              The profile section was optimized for quick access to favorite places and

              In the groups section, we improved the chat function's visibility and 
              relevance, making it clear that it is specific to each group. Additionally, 
              we introduced functionalities such as creating group polls for dining 
              options and checking members' availability for reservations.

              These changes aimed to reduce clutter, provide user control and 
              customization, ensure seamless integration, and maintain consistent 
              design patterns throughout the app.

              Developers prefer not to have generated code directly placed into their directories without prior review. 
              To maintain full control over their development environment, it is essential to allow them to review and, 
              if necessary, regenerate the code before it is finalized. This principle led to the inclusion of the 
              WebView directly in the IDE, to let users have ownership and control of the output.

              When working in their preferred environments, developers seek a simple 
              interface that seamlessly integrates with the general UI, avoiding unnecessary complexity. 
              Following this principle, the components and UI elements of the extension were designed 
              to be subtle and discreet, ensuring they do not overwhelm or draw too much attention. 
              Additionally, to provide the best developer experience, the UX guidelines established by 
              VSCode were thoroughly followed.

              Developers prefer to manage code-related tasks using the IDE’s native interactions. 
              Based on this, we incorporated native patterns and elements from the tools they use daily, 
              respecting their affordances and preferences.

                  <li>They are adept at handling complexity and large volumes of information simultaneously.</li>
                  <li>Developers seek control over their workspace, actions, and output, valuing customisation and precision.</li>
                  <li>While they don’t always require a graphical user interface (GUI), when they do, they expect it to be exceptionally simple and unobtrusive.</li>
                  <li>Furthermore, developers prefer using the native interactions of their integrated development environment (IDE), emphasising the importance of 
                  seamless integration and familiarity in their tools.</li>

              Designing for developers is a challenging task that involves considerable trial and error. 
              In this project, we explored various design options, repeatedly reviewing them with engineers 
              to ensure the best possible experience that seamlessly integrates into the developers' workflow.

            Having coding experience myself, I could relate to many of the issues and behaviors that developers typically encounter. 
            However, each developer has a unique style, behaviors, and preferences, which is why IDEs are generally highly customizable. 
            Finding a solution that could accommodate these diverse preferences was both challenging and, at times, overwhelming.
            <br></br>
            To confirm my assumptions, I validated my design decisions with developers. Even then, their opinions often contrasted 
            with one another, necessitating decisions based on the best possible UX patterns.
