                <h3>User Flows</h3>

                <p>
                    In order to understand which were the most important things for a diabetes patient, we built the
                    user flows to reach the most important actions and information immediately, effortless and
                    safely. This user flows where built with the aid of the users, asking them what were they
                    expecting from the app and the interaction from it.
                </p>

                <br><br><br><br>

                <img src="QuidUF1.png" width="100%" alt="">

                <br><br><br><br>

                <p>
                    This user flow maps all the possibilities that the user has once opened the application, having
                    everything under control he will be able to check his glycemic status at first, and also to
                    check the condition of his product. With this method, the user has the most important information 
                    available at first sight.
                </p>

                <br><br><br><br>

                <img src="QuidUF2.png" width="100%" alt="">

                <br><br>

                <p>
                    This user flow instead explores the other most important feature of our product, within thw food
                    section, the user will be able to inject the right amount of insulin, and will also get aid from
                    the system itself.
                </p>

                <h3>Solution iteration</h3>

                <p>
                    Starting from the information architecture, I developed the wireframed app, without never
                    forgetting the medical aim of the project, how should the user feel and what he is expecting to
                    find.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Particular emphasis has been put on the injection flow, being the most delicate, I studied it 
                    in depth. Starting from the gestural constraints, it was needed to make the injection selection 
                    and action natural and normal, rather than the current state of the art which forces users to 
                    enact weird and old injection movements using the insulin pen. The system has been designed 
                    in order to make users interact only with the app when in social gatherings, managing anything 
                    from there and having full control about their condition and related actions.

                <h3>Insulin Injection</h3>

                <h4>Effortless and normalized injection process</h4>

                <p>
                    The current state-of-the-art products, force users to enact uncomfortable and socially awkward
                    gestures
                    to do their injection process, with the following flow, users will be free to focus on their life
                    while the system will manage the rest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The User Interface has been designed with the aim of creative a calm and controlled environment
                    which could still express safety and cleaning, here's explained why the contrast between blue and
                    green colors. <br>

                    The dimensions of the typeface are due to the eye problems that Diabetics people might face because
                    of their condition,
                    being the eyes' cornea one of the first body area to be reached to collect and compensate the
                    missing sugar in the blood,
                    possibly leading to sight deficits, here's also the reason for such strong contrasts. <br><br>

                    Also, most of the screen are the designed to show fewer information and elements, to still make
                    users feel in total control
                    over their condition focusing on few important elements at a time that could have big impact on
                    users' condition,
                    e.g. food quantity screen…
                </p>

                <img src="Injection2.png" width="100%" alt="">

                <p>
                    The injection itself, can be slightly painful, causing a burning and unpleasant sensation,
                    providing the gimmick of motions and animations, we'll focus user's attention on something
                    else rather than the injection itself, alleviating, as possible, the hurtful circumstances that
                    users face.

                    <h3>What is Diabetes?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of high levels blood glucose
                        (hyperglycemia) and due to an altered quantity or function of insulin.

                        Insulin is the hormone produced by the pancreas that allows glucose to enter cells and its
                        consequent use as an energy source.
                        When this mechanism is altered, glucose accumulates in the bloodstream
                    </p>

                    <h4>Diabetes Type 1</h4>

                    <p>
                        It affects about 10% of people with diabetes and generally occurs in childhood or adolescence.
                        In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce insulin due to the destruction of the ß cells
                        that produce this hormone: it therefore needs to be injected every day and for life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To better understand our user and their needs related to this discomfort, we wrote a long script
                        of 2 hours long interview questions, which we asked 6 people with type 1 diabetes.

                    <p>
                        Our studies allowed us to design and test this organic form that become an extension of the
                        human
                        body.

                    <p>
                        Quid offers a totally flexible system, which adapts to the user’s needs and behaviors,
                        decomposable in different rechargeable parts, so the user can reuse them and not be forced to
                        trash the whole product with the technology inside.

                    <h3>User testing</h3>

                    <p>
                        We involved diabetic patients in our design process for the most harsh and important choices we
                        made, it was a very delicate project, and we wanted to design things with sense and that could
                        actually change some people’s lives.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Engineering collaboration</h4>

                    <p>
                        Also, the system has been designed alongside with a Biomedical Engineer, who was helping us 
                        to shape the most technically feasible product, considering all the possible chemical and 
                        physical constraints, always reporting what could have been done, improved or also when to take 
                        some steps back.

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <p>
                    The project need an in-depth development from the gaming point of view,
                    proving a broad range of options to offer to keep children engaged and
                    interested in paying with it over the time. Also, the development of the
                    app and its content over the time will be required, to always satisfy
                    kids interests and new games.
                </p>

                <h3>What could be improved</h3>

                <h4>Design</h4>

                <p>
                    A mobile app with such interface is really hard to develop, I would
                    redesign it in a more feasible and achievable way, considering the
                    different technical constraints.
